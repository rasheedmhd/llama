DISAMBIGUATING GRAMMAR

The top expression rule matches any expression at any precedence
level. Since equality has the lowest precedence, if we match that, then it
covers everything.

expression → equality

primary    → NUMBER | STRING | "true" | "false" | "nil" | "(" expression ")" ;

Unary operators can nest — !!true is a valid if weird expression — the operand
can itself be a unary operator. A recursive rule handles that nicely.
unary → ( "!" | "-" ) unary | primary;

factor → unary ( ( "/" | "*" ) unary )* ;

(1) pick a non-terminal symbol, α, in the prototype string;
(2) choose a grammar rule, α → β; and
(3) rewrite α with β.
