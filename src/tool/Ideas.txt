If you wanted to turn Lox into an actual useful language, the very first thing you
should do is flesh this out. String manipulation, trigonometric functions, file
I/O, networking, heck, even reading input from the user would help. But we don’t
need any of that for this book, and adding it would not teach you anything
interesting, so I’ve left it out.
